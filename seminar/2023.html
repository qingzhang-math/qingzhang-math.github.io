   <h3> Product of Rankin-Selberg convolutions and a new proof of Jacquet's local converse conjecture </h3>
   <p> <strong> Speaker: </strong> 严盼 （University of Arizona）</p>
   <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We construct a family of integrals which represent the product of Rankin-Selberg L-functions of 
     $GL(\ell)\times GL(m)$ and of $GL(\ell)\times GL(n)$ when $m+n<\ell$. When $n=0$, these integrals are those defined by Jacquet--Piatetski-Shapiro--Shalika 
up to a shift. We study basic properties of these integrals. In particular, we define local gamma factors using this new family 
    of integrals. As an application, we obtain a new proof of Jacquet's local converse conjecture using these new integrals and
       Cogdell--Shahidi--Tsai's theory on partial Bessel functions. This is joint work with Qing Zhang.</p>

<h3>Proofs of Zagier’s rank two examples for Nahm’s conjecture  </h3>
   <p> <strong>Speaker:</strong> <a href="http://jszy.whu.edu.cn/lqwang/zh_CN/index.htm">王六权</a> (武汉大学) </p>
    <p> <strong> Abstract: </strong> Let $r\geq 1$ be a positive integer, $A$ a real positive 
      definite symmetric $r\times r$ matrix, $B$ a vector of length $r$, 
      and $C$ a scalar. Nahm's problem is to describe all such $A,B$ and 
      $C$ with rational entries for which a specific $r$-fold $q$-hypergeometric 
      series (denoted by $f_{A,B,C}(q)$) involving the parameters $A,B,C$ is a modular form.
      When the rank $r=2$, Zagier provided eleven sets of examples of $(A,B,C)$ for which $f_{A,B,C}(q)$ 
      is likely to be a modular form. We present a number of Rogers-Ramanujan type identities involving double
      sums, which give modular form representations for Zagier's rank two examples. Together with several 
      known cases in the literature, we verified all of Zagier's examples. In particular, we give 
      the first $q$-series proof for the tenth example, whose explicit form was conjectured by 
      Vlasenko and Zwegers in 2011. Part of this talk is based on a joint work with 
      Zhineng Cao and Hjalmar Rosengren.</p>

<h3> Title: On the growth of Tate-Shafarevich groups in $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension </h3>
  <p> <strong> Speaker:</strong> <a href="http://maths.ccnu.edu.cn/info/1040/1455.htm"> 林明辉</a> (华中师范大学)</p>
<p> <strong> Abstract: </strong>  Around the 1960s, Iwasawa established a regularity in the growth of the Sylow p-subgroup 
  of the class groups of the intermediate subfields of a $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension of a number field F. Later works of Mazur, Greenberg 
  and Lee showed that the Tate-Shafarevich group of an elliptic curve E also possesses such a regular growth when the 
  elliptic curve E in question has good ordinary reduction at p. When E has good supersingular reduction at p, it was 
  only thanks to the vision of Kobayashi, and a subsequent follow-up work of Iovita and Pollack, that we have an 
  asymptotic formula for the growth in $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension at which the Mordell-Weil rank of E is bounded. In this talk, 
  we will study the growth of the Tate-Shafarevich groups of an elliptic curve with good supersingular reduction 
  at p over the anticyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension of an imaginary quadratic field under the generalized Heegner condition,
  where the latter condition forces the Mordell-Weil rank to be unbounded. This is a joint work with Antonio Lei and 
  Katharina Mueller. </p>
