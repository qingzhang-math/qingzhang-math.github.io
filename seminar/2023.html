<h3>Proofs of Zagier’s rank two examples for Nahm’s conjecture  </h3>
   <p> <strong>Speaker:</strong> <a href="http://jszy.whu.edu.cn/lqwang/zh_CN/index.htm">王六权</a> (武汉大学) </p>
    <p> <strong> Abstract: </strong> Let $r\geq 1$ be a positive integer, $A$ a real positive 
      definite symmetric $r\times r$ matrix, $B$ a vector of length $r$, 
      and $C$ a scalar. Nahm's problem is to describe all such $A,B$ and 
      $C$ with rational entries for which a specific $r$-fold $q$-hypergeometric 
      series (denoted by $f_{A,B,C}(q)$) involving the parameters $A,B,C$ is a modular form.
      When the rank $r=2$, Zagier provided eleven sets of examples of $(A,B,C)$ for which $f_{A,B,C}(q)$ 
      is likely to be a modular form. We present a number of Rogers-Ramanujan type identities involving double
      sums, which give modular form representations for Zagier's rank two examples. Together with several 
      known cases in the literature, we verified all of Zagier's examples. In particular, we give 
      the first $q$-series proof for the tenth example, whose explicit form was conjectured by 
      Vlasenko and Zwegers in 2011. Part of this talk is based on a joint work with 
      Zhineng Cao and Hjalmar Rosengren.</p>
